This week, the team will create a new Maven project and create the endpoints defined in last week's homework for your final project.
Each student should contribute equaly and students will be graded individually.
For now, since we don't have the API connected to a database, just return mocked data from your controller methods (your endpoints).
Mocked data means fake data, not from the database. You can use a collection, like a List, to store data while the server is running.
