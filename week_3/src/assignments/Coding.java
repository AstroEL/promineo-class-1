	 * Coding - Refactor your menu driven application from last weeks homework to 
	 * use methods instead of just a procedural programming style. Create as many 
	 * methods as needed to make it more readable; at minimum, you should have 
	 * 1) a method that prints your menu (user choices available); 2) and a method 
	 * that handles each decision (what happens when a user picks an option).
	 * 
	 * After refactoring, add an array to your application and write functionality 
	 * that allows the user to 1) add a new element to the array; 2) view a specific 
	 * element in the array; 3) display all elements in the array; 4) delete a specific 
	 * element in the array; 5) delete all elements in the array.
	 * Create proper validation to ensure an exception isn't thrown while reading 
	 * or writing from the array.
