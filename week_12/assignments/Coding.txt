This week you will be working together as a team to create a full CRUD application.
Your console CRUD application will need to use a database to store all the application data.
You need to have at least 3 entities.
Users should be able to interact via the console (i.e. Scanner(System.in)))
You can organize your code however you like, but I would encourage you to follow an organizational
model similar to the one in last weeks video with packages dao, entity, and if you need, service.
The project must be on GitHub. Use git to collaborate.
Everyone will be graded on their individual contributions.
This project is worth 200 points as it is taking the place of your research assignment and quiz.
